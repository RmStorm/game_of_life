To get a proper handle on what this WASM thing is all about I figured I would do a little project as close to the basics as possible. I found this article https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html but since it's 4 years old there was a whole bunch of stuff that didn't work. So instead of simply following along it turned into a quite nice project.

I also made a nice interface by writing 200 lines of JS. Came out pretty fun!

To run simply do:

```bash
npm run start
```
